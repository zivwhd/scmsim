1,Return of the Jedi (1983),Mission: Impossible (1996),-0.52590215,0,"While both are blockbuster franchises, there is no narrative or genre continuity. Viewers interested in 'Star Wars' are not causally more likely to watch a spy action film like 'Mission: Impossible,' and vice versa; any overlap is due to general blockbuster/watch behavior rather than a causal relationship."
